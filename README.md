# Project Setup and Running Guide

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up and running the project on your local machine. We'll cover everything from installing Node.js to running the project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): A JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript on the server side.
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/): A package manager for JavaScript that comes bundled with Node.js.

## Step 1: Install Node.js

1. **Download Node.js**:
   - Visit the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).
   - Download the recommended version for your operating system.

2. **Install Node.js**:
   - Follow the installation instructions provided on the website.
   - Ensure that npm is installed along with Node.js.

## Step 2: Clone the Project Repository

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project.git
   ```
   Replace `https://github.com/yourusername/project.git` with the actual URL of your project repository.

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd project
   ```

## Step 3: Install Project Dependencies

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This command will install all the necessary dependencies listed in your `package.json` file.

## Step 4: Run the Project

1. **Run the project**:
   ```bash
   npm run serve
   ```
   This command will start a local development server. The project will be accessible in your web browser.

## Step 5: Access the Project

**Open your web browser**:
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:8080` (or the specified port if different).
   - You should see your project running.
